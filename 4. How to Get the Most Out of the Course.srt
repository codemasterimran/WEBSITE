Hi guys and welcome to the course. Now after thousands of students have taken this course I've compiled
1

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:13,470
some of the top tips from the most successful students to help you make the most of your time on the
2

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,310
course.
3

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,090
So I know what I do with instruction manuals when I receive them.
4

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,250
But this is not it.
5

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,990
Because I want to share with you some of the most useful tips that will help you learn to code and get
6

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,460
the most out of the course.
7

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,200
So first tip is as you go from lesson to lesson in the course you'll find that each of the lessons should
8

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,570
take about 10 minutes long.
9

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,020
And this is something that we intentionally designed for the course.
10

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,890
Now a lot of students, when they're watching video tutorials online very often what people do, is they'll
11

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,790
watch the video and type along to the code.
12

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,530
And this is what we tend to call code along.
13

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,260
So the tutorial types a bit. You type a bit. You try to keep up with the pace of the tutorial or you pause
14

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,240
the video every so often to catch up. But essentially you're coding along with the instructor.
15

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,280
And this is probably one of the most intuitive ways for people to learn from online tutorials.
16

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,210
Now in order for you to be more successful than most people. What I would recommend is: instead to watch
17

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,280
the video tutorials, which are usually as I said about 10 minutes long.
18

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,700
If it's a 20 minute or a 50-minute tutorial then stop it and around the 10-minute mark And while you're
19

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,780
watching it, instead of spending time trying to frantically type out the code, I want you instead to just
20

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:44,130
try and understand what's going on. Why the code is being written and understand the purpose of the code
21

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,310
rather than trying to type along at the same pace.
22

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,770
Now once you've understood what those 10 minutes are about; what the tutorial is trying to teach you
23

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,590
then to go to your computer and type out the code and try to replicate what happened in the 10 minutes.
24

25
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,030
Now the reason why this helps people learn so much better is because, instead of just copying code by
25

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,510
rote, which doesn't teach you anything.
26

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,610
Instead, it forces you to really understand what's going on and absorb the content and then test yourself
27

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,460
afterwards to see if you really understood.
28

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,110
So this is my number one top tip.
29

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,970
And it's important to remember that we are learning programming. We're not learning how to type fast. It
30

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,570
doesn't help you become a better programmer by just copying out code as fast as you can.
31

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,910
If you wanted to practice your typing and to speed up your typing skills then I recommend something
32

33
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:52,470
like keybr.com where you can focus on that specific skill to improve your speed of typing.
33

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,760
But what we're going to focus on in the course is learning programming.
34

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,390
So we're going to keep our eye on the prize.
35

36
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,270
Now while you're listening to the videos and you're understanding what's going on, I recommend taking
36

37
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,170
a few notes for yourself to come back to or review in the future.
37

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,910
And this is especially useful after when those 10 minutes are up and you're trying to remember one of
38

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,600
those bits of code that you had to type and what was the theory that was covered.
39

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,350
So one of my favorite note-taking systems is something called Cornell notes. And it's very very simple.
40

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,830
It just splits a single note page into 4 sections. At the top, you have the topic of what the notes are
41

42
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,050
about. And then you have the section of notes where you would write down the majority of your notes.
42

43
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:47,760
Now after you write a few lines it's recommended that you go and review those notes and pick out the
43

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,880
most important keywords or questions that you're asking yourself that you want to research on later
44

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,790
or any sort of hints or reminders to yourself.
45

46
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,570
And finally once you've completed the lesson then you go to the summary section and you summarize what
46

47
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,050
the entire lesson was about in a few bullet points.
47

48
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,550
So I've created a downloadable PDF of this note-taking system.
48

49
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,100
So if you're keen to try it out, go ahead and download it from the course resources section and you can
49

50
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,700
print it out into a notebook or just on a few loose sheets if you want to try it out.
50

51
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,790
Now the next thing to remember is that if I'm talking too fast or too slow you can always change the
51

52
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,080
playback speed.
52

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,750
Now if you're in a lesson that you find particularly easy to understand and you already know most of
53

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,090
the concepts, then go ahead and switch the video player to double speed so that you can cover much more
54

55
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,330
ground in the same space of time.
55

56
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,220
Now on the other hand if I'm talking too fast or if English is not your first language then feel free
56

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,370
to change the speed to half-speed, so that I talk a lot slower and you can take up the information
57

58
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,150
more readily.
58

59
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,730
But it's important that you try to not skip any of the tutorials on any of the modules.
59

60
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:11,360
And the reason is that the curriculum was carefully designed so that it would be a smooth sloping
60

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,740
ramp so that you start out at the beginning and you slowly make your way through more and more difficult
61

62
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,930
concepts.
62

63
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,990
Now if you skip a couple of modules then it makes it really, really hard for you to catch up and to understand
63

64
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,940
what's going on, which is the most important thing.
64

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,740
However some of the videos I will label with optional or skippable and in that case feel free to skip
65

66
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,990
those lessons if they don't interest you.
66

67
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,460
Now the next thing to remember is that if you find at any point the tutorials become harder and they
67

68
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,330
inevitably will be they're designed to get harder and harder.
68

69
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:57,020
But if you find that it's a little bit too difficult, then I recommend just bookmarking it.
69

70
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:04,490
Making a note of which module you really struggled with and trying to use that method of watching the
70

71
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,870
videos for 10 minutes, reviewing what has been taught, trying to replicate the code yourself.
71

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:15,770
But if you're still stuck and you really don't understand what's going on then that might be something
72

73
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,950
that you have to come back to.
73

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,190
So I find that usually with programming concepts it helps to try it out, read around the topic, and then
74

75
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,930
come back to it after a week or so. And very often
75

76
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,510
what was very very difficult the first time you come across it, after you've done it a few times, after you've
76

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,350
researched around the topic and then you come back to it, it becomes a lot easier.
77

78
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,570
So remember to mark things for review that you don't understand.
78

79
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:53,690
Now recently I went to learn windsurfing in Mykonos. And it's a skill that I've never had before.
79

80
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,620
It's something that I found incredibly challenging. And I fell on my face during the entire lesson pretty
80

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,780
much and it hurt a lot.
81

82
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:09,350
I got battered and bruised. And my ego got bruised a lot as well. But this is exactly what it's like when
82

83
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:17,960
you try to learn a new skill so it's important that you persevere and continue to put in the hours to
83

84
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,940
practice and to try and try again. Because you can learn something very superficially just by watching
84

85
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:34,070
a video or you know trying it for a few hours. But in order to master a skill, the most important thing
85

86
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,520
is practice.
86

87
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,700
Now the final thing is that I will say it now you will get stuck at some point because everybody does
87

88
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,750
And in fact, I wish that Hollywood would stop making movies where programmers are just typing away, like
88

89
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,350
some sort of frenzied hacker person. Because most of the programmers I know who actually do this as a
89

90
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:04,610
job, they spend probably 90% of their time just staring at the screen trying to figure out what
90

91
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,390
is wrong.
91

92
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,120
Why is it not working?
92

93
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:15,020
So getting stuck is very much a universal part of programming; something that you have to come to even
93

94
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,380
love and enjoy.
94

95
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,510
So when you do find yourself stuck, I want you to imagine that you're already a fully-fledged developer,
95

96
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,990
working a job where somebody is paying you to do this for them, because you're the professional.
96

97
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:38,390
So I want you to use the tools that professional programmers use when they get stuck. And that is Google
97

98
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,770
and Stack Overflow.
98

99
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,580
Try to figure it out. Try to see: what did other people do?
99

100
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:50,230
Because 99% of the time, you won't be the first person who's come across that problem.
100

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,090
It's very likely that somebody has experienced that before and other people have helped them to solve
101

102
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:02,840
that problem or help them understand what it is they're stuck on. And the thing to remember is that struggling
102

103
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:10,040
is good. In that moment when you finally spot that typo or finally figure out why it is that your code
103

104
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,900
isn't working and you fix it.
104

105
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,970
That is one of the best feelings in the world. So struggle is good. And it really is through the struggles
105

106
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,410
that you actually improve and level up your skills.
106

107
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:33,350
So I'm so excited to be on this journey with you and I look forward to all of your success in the future!
