1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,710
All right. So now let's tackle what exactly is HTML, and how do we use it to structure our web sites.
1

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,260
So no matter what you use as your browser - it could be Chrome,
2

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,350
it could be Safari or Firefox -
3

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:24,330
they all have a single purpose, and that's to interpret your files such as your HTML files, your CSS files,
4

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,240
your Javascript files, into a web site that should be displayed.
5

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,440
So, for example, we've got a little bit of HTML code here that says that our web site should have a title
6

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,700
called
7

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,410
Hello.
8

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,180
And in the body there should be a heading that says Hello World.
9

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,240
So if we pass that code into our browser it will open it and display it like so, with the title of the
10

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,890
web site usually on the tab bar, and that h1, or that big heading, showing up in the body of our web site.
11

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,580
So, before we dive deep into this, it's really important to remember that HTML is the foundation of
12

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,780
all web sites.
13

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:10,890
So, for example, you won't see web sites that are created using just a CSS file or just a Javascript file
14

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,260
but you can create web sites using just an HTML file.
15

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,510
Now it might not look great.
16

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,970
It'll probably look like it came from the 90s but it does enable your web site to display text or various
17

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,310
elements such as images or forms or tables depending on how you code up the HTML file.
18

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,320
So, HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and the really important part here is the word
19

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,230
markup because there's many markup languages.
20

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,400
For example you might have heard of things such as XML, Extensible Markup Language, or GML, Generalized
21

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,850
Markup Language, and all of these languages share a common history.
22

23
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:59,130
They're based off the markup that used to be put into manuscripts where editors would mark up the manuscript
23

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,190
and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers.
24

25
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,580
So for example you might have the squiggly line that shows the publishers that this part should be printed
25

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,000
in bold or this part should be printed in italics, and HTML works in much the same way.
26

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,120
You can specify the layout and structure of your website by using HTML tags.
27

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,610
So if you head over to your browser and go to a web site called codepen.io, then we can have a
28

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,370
look and have a play around with real life HTML. So, you don't have to sign up.
29

30
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,600
Just head over to codepen.io, and then hit Create, New Pen, and then we're going to change the view
30

31
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,560
to a format like this.
31

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,000
So this is the live version of our web site and these are the places where we're going to put our code.
32

33
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,950
So, as you can see, Code Pen let’s you put in HTML, CSS and Javascript, which will together get interpreted
33

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
and get shown on the left as your web site.
34

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Now, as we're only working with HTML at the moment, I'm going to minimize the CSS and Javascript sections
35

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,500
and I'm just going to work from the HTML section.
36

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,430
Now we're going to need some text to work with or have something which we can give structure to.
37

38
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,870
If you head over to gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661, you get taken to The Adventures of Sherlock
38

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,870
Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.
39

40
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,760
So one of my favorite books of all time.
40

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,990
If you have a look down here you can see that you can view the book as plain text
41

42
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,750
or you can read this book online as HTML.
42

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,870
So this is what the plain text looks like.
43

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,390
It has all of the text in the book but absolutely no structure.
44

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,200
But, when we have a look at the HTML file, you can see that it has laid out the book with a structure
45

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,570
that is more human readable.
46

47
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,030
And this is what we're going to replicate using HTML.
47

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,620
So if you go ahead and just copy this part -The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -
48

49
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,670
and you copy and place it into your pen,
49

50
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:22,530
so in the HTML section here. Now you can see that all of this text gets put onto the screen with absolutely
50

51
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,410
no structure.
51

52
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,900
And in order for this to start looking like this we're going to start adding a little bit of HTML.
52

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,590
So the first thing we can see is that this is the largest heading on the page. So we can make our website
53

54
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,460
look like that
54

55
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,010
also, by adding an h1 tag into our HTML. So the tags start with angular brackets and end with angular brackets
55

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,640
and in the middle is the type of element or the type of tag you want to use.
56

57
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,950
Now it's really important that when you open tags that you also close them, because as you can see here
57

58
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,510
I've got an open tag
58

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:08,500
but I have yet to close it, and it thinks that the entire contents of my page should be made into the
59

60
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,440
largest heading possible and that's not what I want.
60

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
I only want it for this section - The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
61

62
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,450
So, in order to close the tag, it's the same angle brackets,
62

63
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,070
but then I have to use a forward slash and then write h1.
63

64
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,180
So now only this part is an h1 or a large heading.
64

65
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,280
Now if we have a look at the other parts I would say that this word - by - is a little bit smaller than
65

66
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,380
the author's name.
66

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,540
So let's structure this as a heading also.
67

68
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,900
But let's make it a subtitle so let's make it a slightly smaller heading and to do that we can simply
68

69
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,240
wrap this text around an h2 tag. And now we have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a heading but in a smaller
69

70
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,870
size and shown with less importance than the big title.
70

71
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,350
So now finally we have this word - by -
71

72
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,900
and I reckon that's one size smaller than this heading, so let's go ahead and wrap this inside an h3.
72

73
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,840
So I hope you're starting to get the gist.
73

74
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,760
The heading tags get smaller as the number goes up.
74

75
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:27,640
So for example if I changed this to an h4 it gets even smaller, h5 smaller still, and all the way
75

76
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,000
until h6, which is the smallest font size for the heading element.
76

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Now, if you keep going to h7, you'll notice that it doesn't do anything anymore.
77

78
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:49,420
It doesn't change the heading size and that's because the heading elements only go from h1 to h6.
78

79
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,220
Now how do I know that, 
79

80
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,480
I hear you ask.
80

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,330
So this is a good point in the course to introduce documentation.
81

82
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,270
And the reason why I'm talking about it so early on is because of how important it is to your journey
82

83
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,110
as a web developer.
83

84
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,280
So one of the key skills in becoming a great web developer, or in fact any sort of programmer, is getting
84

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,310
good at finding out how you can help yourself and a lot of that involves getting good at googling.
85

86
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,730
How do you find the specific piece of information that's going to help you achieve what it is that you
86

87
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,120
want or help you understand what it is that you want to know.
87

88
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:36,340
So in this case we're talking about headings and we are using HTML and I'm going to add in the name of
88

89
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,920
the documentation that I prefer to use which is MDN and it stands for the Mozilla Developer Network,
89

90
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,090
so the same people who made Firefox for example.
90

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,200
So if I go ahead and hit enter,
91

92
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,630
you see a whole bunch of results come up.
92

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,130
And the most relevant for us is the h1 to h6 and it talks about headings.
93

94
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,110
So if we click on that you can learn more about the heading elements used in HTML and they even have
94

95
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,330
example code snippets that show you what it would look like rendered in a browser.
95

96
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,530
Now there's a couple of sources for documentation.
96

97
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,470
One is of course MDN. Another one is called W3 Schools.
97

98
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,300
So let's see if we try W3 Schools with HTML
98

99
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,650
and we're talking about headings, right?
99

100
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,090
Let’s see what we get here.
100

101
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,970
So HTML Headings is the first result that comes up.
101

102
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,680
And similarly you've got the code examples, you've got the results and you've got a little bit of notes
102

103
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,610
that tell you how you should be using your headings.
103

104
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,990
So both of these places have a lot of really useful usage notes and it's worth reading through when you’re 
104

105
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,460
first coming across a particular element.
105

106
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,570
That way you'll have a good foundation of knowledge when you start to build and create your own web sites.
106

107
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,430
So I want to show you one last resource that I quite like using, which is called 
107

108
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,190
devdocs.io.
108

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,100
And this is basically a web site that puts together a lot of the useful documentation in a structure that
109

110
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,320
I find to be quite handy.
110

111
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:13,630
So if we have a look inside the HTML5 tab, and we go into the elements, we can see that there's a total
111

112
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:20,490
of 135 elements and if you scroll down you can see that we've got h1 through to h6.
112

113
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,600
And if you click on any of these then it brings up actually the MDN documentation so you can see
113

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
that it's similar to what we saw on MDN but it's just structured in a very simple way and it's very
114

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
easy to follow.
115

116
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,240
So that's definitely a web site that's worth bookmarking.
116

117
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,380
So if we head back over to our HTML file we’re going to change that back to an h3, which is an
117

118
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,280
HTML tag that actually exists as opposed to something like h9.
118

119
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,150
So the next thing that we need to do in order to better replicate this web site is to add some space
119

120
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,160
between these lines.
120

121
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,620
Now in a word processor such as Word or Google Docs you'll be able to simply just hit enter a few times or
121

122
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,240
hit return a few times and get that spacing show up.
122

123
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,050
Now unfortunately in HTML it doesn't quite work like that.
123

124
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,290
It's a little bit more complicated. In order to create that spacing,
124

125
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,510
we actually have to use an HTML element called a line break and it's written like so.
125

126
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,280
And the interesting thing about this HTML element is that it doesn't require both an open and a close
126

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,020
tag.
127

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,190
So we have the h1 through to h6 tags.
128

129
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,090
You can see that we started out by marking the text with an h1 and then we close it off with a closing
129

130
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:45,530
tag but the line break element works all by itself and you can even put it inside like so to make this
130

131
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,390
part go onto a new line.
131

132
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,690
Now this is a good time point to review the anatomy of HTML tags.
