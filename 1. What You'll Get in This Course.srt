Welcome to the complete web developer boot camp. My name is Angela.
1

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,060
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the App Brewery,
2

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:23,160
London's highest-rated programming Bootcamp. To date, I taught over 120,000 students - in person and online.
3

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,310
I'm so excited that I now have the privilege of being your instructor for this course. In the coming
4

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,950
lessons
5

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,820
you can look forward to the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.
6

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,160
So it doesn't matter if you've never programmed before.
7

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,660
because I'm going to start at the beginning and I'll take you step by step so that you understand every
8

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,540
single line of code that we write together. We'll be covering some of the latest tools and technology
9

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:01:00,400
including HTML, CSS,  Javascript, MongoDB,  Express JS ... and a whole lot more.
10

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,880
As a student on this course, you're going to be saving yourself a lot of time because instead of having
11

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:15,220
to deal with outdated or incomprehensible tutorials, you now get access to a fully up-to-date curriculum
12

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,860
which is going to take you from beginner to mastery.
13

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,120
You're also going to be saving yourself a lot of money because instead of having to take time off work
14

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,560
or spend tens of thousands of dollars on an in-person programming bootcamp, you'll get access to exactly
15

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,070
the same content, but you get to do it in your own time and on your own terms for a fraction of the
16

17
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,970
price.
17

18
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,650
By the end of the course, you will be fluently programming by yourself and along the way, you will have
18

19
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:54,880
built over 16 fully-fledged websites and a web application ready to take on a job as a professional
19

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,850
developer or to build your next tech startup.
20

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,870
One of my greatest passions in life is understanding how humans learn.
21

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:14,590
I've spent years researching programming education and applying what I found to designing bootcamp curriculums.
22

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,560
I have some of the highest-rated development courses across the web but don't just take my word for
23

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:32,450
it. Check out my past students had to say.
24

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,310
This is the most comprehensive and most up to date course on full-stack web development.
25

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,830
There are new modules being added constantly to make sure that you are always up to date with the latest
26

27
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,180
technologies.
27

28
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,850
As a student on this course
28

29
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,140
you now have access to everything you need to learn to code and become a web developer.
29

30
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,820
So what are you still waiting for?
30

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,970
Join me on the next lesson and let's get started.
